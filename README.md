# Bomoda-Weibo-Project
In this project, I mainly used mrjob module in Python to perform the word count tasks. For each questions, I merged all of the json files in each of the weibo folder to a single json file (`merged_status.json,merged_comment.json,merged_repost.json`). The output results are written in .txt files in each of the question folders.
